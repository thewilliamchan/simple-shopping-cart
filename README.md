Lab: To Do List
Before moving on to jQuery, it is important to revisit all the concepts we have learned so far. And there is no better way to do it than creating an application. In this lab, we will be creating a simple to-do list, where we use JavaScript to dynamically add and remove elements to and from the DOM (Document Object Model). This will give you a chance to review how JavaScript can interact with elements on a web page.
Scope

We will keep our todolist app features at the bare minimum. Here is the list:
An element that renders a list of to-do items.
Each to-do item has a description and a remove button.
An input element and a button that lets user add a new to-do item.
Directory Set Up

You should work on this lab locally on your computer. First, through your terminal, or directly in your file viewer, create a new directory called "todolist". Within that folder, create three files named index.html, index.css, index.js.
